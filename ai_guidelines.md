#### 1. Guiding Principles
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in this course or laboratory is governed by the principles of <strong><span style="color:darkred;">academic integrity, transparency, and accountability</span></strong>. Students are responsible for ensuring that all submitted work, including coursework, laboratory reports, project work, data analyses, and written outputs, accurately reflects their own learning and intellectual contribution and complies with the stated guidelines. AI tools may be used as permitted support, <strong><span style="color:darkred;">not as a substitute for independent thinking, analysis, interpretation, or authorship</span></strong>, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This guideline adopts the University’s guidance on AI use for students, as outlined by the [LTTC](https://lttc2024.eduhk.hk/for-students/guidelines-for-using-ai-tools-students/).


#### 2. Permitted Uses of AI
Unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, task, or laboratory activity, students may use AI tools for the following purposes, provided that all AI assisted output is critically reviewed, edited, and integrated by the student, and that the final submission reflects the student’s own work and academic judgment:
- Language support, including grammar checking, proofreading, stylistic refinement, and translation  
- Brainstorming and idea generation, where AI outputs are used as prompts and are critically evaluated, selectively adopted, and substantially refined by the student  
- Assisting with organization, outlining, or clarity of expression in written work or presentations  
- Clarifying concepts or generating study aids for personal understanding  
- Use of AI as a critical conversational partner (e.g. to question assumptions, generate counterarguments, or reflect on alternative interpretations), provided the student independently evaluates and integrates such input 
- Understanding analytical methods or statistical approaches  
- Improving clarity in reporting procedures or results  
- Supporting interpretation of findings, , provided that conclusions, implications, and evaluations remain student-driven  

#### 3. Core Requirement: Evidence of Individual Input
All submitted work must demonstrate <strong><span style="color:darkred;">clear evidence of individual intellectual input</span></strong>, including:

- Independent reasoning and judgement  
- Critical engagement with relevant theories, evidence, data, or practice  
- Coherent argumentation or interpretation that reflects the student’s own position  
- Meaningful synthesis rather than reproduction of AI-generated content  

Where a submission lacks clear evidence of individual contribution, it may be subject to further review, regardless of whether AI use was declared. Further review may involve clarification with the student, educational guidance, or referral under the University’s academic integrity procedures

#### 4. Prohibited Uses of AI
The only prohibited use of AI is submitting work that does not demonstrate sufficient evidence of the student’s own intellectual input, decision-making, and critical engagement.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Accepting AI outputs without evaluation or modification  
- Relying on AI to determine arguments, interpretations, experimental conclusions, or analytic decisions  
- Submitting AI-generated content, analyses, or interpretations that the student cannot explain or justify  

#### 5. Mandatory AI Use Statement in Submitted Work
All students must include an **AI Use Statement** in their submitted work, including coursework, laboratory reports, project submissions, and written assignments. If no AI tools were used, students should explicitly state this.

If AI tools were used, the statement must clearly specify:
- The AI tool and company (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)  
- The language model or version, if known (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3)  
- The access route or platform (e.g. EdUHK’s ChatGPT service, Poe, direct website with link)  
- The purpose of use (e.g. translation, language enhancement, brainstorming, analytic support)  
- The approximate extent of use, referring to the proportion of the writing, planning, or analysis process that involved AI assistance

Example AI Use Statements

Example 1: Enhancing Academic Language with AI
> I acknowledge using EdUHK’s ChatGPT service (OpenAI, GPT-4), accessed via https://chatgpt.eduhk.hk, to enhance the academic language of my work. The tool was used to check language accuracy and improve writing style. All ideas, structure, and analysis are my own.

Example 2: Brainstorming Project Ideas with AI
> I acknowledge using Poe (Anthropic, Claude 3), accessed via https://poe.com, as a brainstorming aid to generate initial project ideas. The AI-generated suggestions were critically evaluated and substantially refined, and the final project was independently developed.


Example 3: Translation Support with AI
> I acknowledge using ChatGPT (OpenAI, version 5.2), accessed via the direct website https://chatgpt.com, to translate my original work from Chinese to English. The original content, structure, and arguments were independently developed by me. The AI tool was used solely for translation and language support, and I reviewed and edited the translated text to ensure accuracy, clarity, and fidelity to my original meaning.

#### 6. AI Detection and Review Process
AI detection tools may be used as a supporting reference only. Detection results alone do not constitute evidence of academic misconduct. Where concerns arise regarding the level of individual intellectual input, students may be asked to explain, justify, or elaborate on their submitted work, including methodological or analytical decisions. An inability to do so may indicate insufficient evidence of individual contribution.

#### 7. Responsibility and Accountability
Students are fully accountable for all submitted work. Use of AI does not remove responsibility for accuracy, originality, or academic standards. Students are responsible for verifying the accuracy of all content, data interpretations, references, and claims, including any material produced or assisted by AI tools.

#### 8. When in Doubt
Where assignment- or laboratory-specific instructions impose stricter limitations on AI use, those instructions take precedence over this general guideline. When unsure about the appropriateness of AI use, students should consult the course instructor or laboratory supervisor before submission. Transparency is always expected.
